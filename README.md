# CS330_Final_Project
Final 3D scene created for CS-330

My approach to designing software is to take things slowly and fully plan out what I would like to create before I begin writing code. This way, I ensure that all of my code writing process is efficient and covers all of the necessary functionalities. This project was my first attempt at creating objects using basic shape meshes in a 3D space. I learned how to load and draw shapes, apply textures, set up lighting, and create a camera that could navigate my 3D world space. 

When planning out my 3D scene, my first step was to break down what shapes each object in my 3D scene could be made out of. Then deciding what kind of textures each one would require. And finally, deciding where the lights in my scene would need to go to best illuminate the shapes and the depth of each object. I will look to approach future project in the same way, by planning ahead of time as much as possible so that I waste no time deciding later on what needs to be done. Setting clear and decisive goals for myself to reach, and breaking each project into bite sized chuncks so that I do not get overwhelmed.

Each iteration/milestone added onto the project and applied a new concept and idea. This made the learning process much simpler. I was able to fully grasp a concept and apply it to my project before moving onto the next. The module that gave me the most trouble was module 6, lighting. It took me a while to understand what each value meant, and how to manipulate those values to get the desired results. 

I believe that learning about computational graphics can help me in the future by providing me with experience that I may use down the road. By continuing to learn about 3D graphics development, I can open more doors for myself and give myself other opportunities for employement after graduation. The more I learn the more useful I make myself to possible employers.
